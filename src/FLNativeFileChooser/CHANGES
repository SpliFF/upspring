0.86 - 09/05/2009      -- applied patches received from users
-----------------------------------------------------

	o NO API CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE -- FIXES ONLY

        o Applied Gary Hui Zhang's patch from fltk.developer 09/04/2009
	  to use FsRef instead of FsSpec (to support OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard)
	
	o Applied Walter Garm's recommendations to remove BIF_SHAREABLE
	  from the WIN32 flags.
	  
	  When BIF_SHAREABLE is specified, apparently it HIDES shareable
	  drives in BROWSE_DIRECTORY mode. In his case (and mine) 
	  mapped network drives (eg. Z: -> \\meade\net) would NOT
	  show up in BROWSE_DIRECTORY mode if the BIF_SHAREABLE enabled.
	  (Drive would only show up if specified as the preset filename)

	o Applied Manolo's 3 suggestions from Oct 08 2008:

	    > Remove the 'Default' format from BROWSE_SAVE_FILE dialog
	      by adding kNavGenericSignature as 3rg argument of
	      NavCreatePutFileDialog()

	    > Fixed BROWSE_SAVE_FILE to not fail if file does not exist yet

	    > Converted all kCFStringEncodingASCII -> kCFStringEncodingUTF8

	o 4 space indent conformation

0.85
-----------------------------------------------------
	o Enable options(fltk::NativeFileChooser::NEW_FOLDER) to work for Mac.
	  fltk1 & fltk2 docs for options() updated; NEW_FOLDER flag turned green for Mac.
	  Feature added for Mark Brevoort. Posted patch to fltk.general on 11/21/07.

        o Updated the COPYING file to be LGPL (somehow a GPL license got in there)

0.84 -- 10/01/2007 release
-----------------------------------------------------
	o FLTK2 SUPPORT!
	  Merged in Frederic Hoerni's mods for fltk2 support, 
	  converted to fltk2 style namespace.

	o Makefile fix for IMGLIB from Gonzalo Garramuno (fltk.general 09/30/07)

	o Incorporated Ian MacArthur's Makefile for fltk-config

	o 80 column compliance

	o Build: 
	    > Tar file now extracts with version number in the directory name,
	    > 'make tar' logic now moved into separate shell script

	o Windows:
            > Fixed memory leak with lpstrFile (alloc'ed twice)
	    > Removed unused strfree() code in ClearOFN()
	    > Small code formatting fixes


0.83d -- 11/23/2006 fix release
-----------------------------------------------------
	o Linux:
	    > Added Shane Hill's #include <sys/stat.h> to Fl_Native_File_Chooser_FLTK.cxx

	o Windows:
	    > Added OFN_NOCHANGEDIR flag to prevent GetOpenFileName() from changing the CWD
	    > Added Andreas Sch?mann's fix for _nfilters++ to the add_filter() method
	    > Fixed showfile() GetCurrentDirectory() call

	o Copyright fixes and README.txt brought up to date


0.83c -- 02/03/2006 fix release
-----------------------------------------------------
        o Windows: 
	    > Fixed behavior of BROWSE_SAVE_FILE
	    > Fixed SAVEAS_CONFIRM 
	    > Mods to getcwd() macros in test-browser.cxx for MINGW
	    > Fixes to test-browser.cxx for MinGW compiles (removed #ifdef VISUAL_STUDIO)

	o Linux:
	    > "Save File" now has working "Show SaveAs Confirm" dialog
	    > "Save File" under linux wasn't letting user type in a filename
            > 'int type()' method wasn't implemented, added _btype
	    > Removed ifeq() cruft from Makefile.LINUX

	o Applied Ian's fixes to Makefile.fltkconfig
	o Makefile was sourcing user's ~/.cshrc, added '-f' to SHELL=/bin/csh -f

0.83b -- 01/07/2006 erco: small patches from Ian
------------------------------------------------
	o Makefile.fltkconfig WINDOWS -> WIN32
	o Tar forces owner/group to 0/0, fixed perms on images dir

0.83a -- 01/06/2006 erco: small patches from Ian
------------------------------------------------
	o Makefile.fltkconfig patch
	o Enforce correct perms on files in tar file

0.83 -- 12/06/2005 erco: misc 
-----------------------------------------------
        o Windows: Added preset_file() support
	o Linux: missing filters() method
	o All: Added options() to API, removed macosx_*()
	o Added options() to the API with flags:
		o NEW_FOLDER
		o PREVIEW
		o SAVEAS_CONFIRM
	o Removed macosx_*() stuff -- bad idea

0.82 -- 12/05/2005 erco: misc fixes after merge
-----------------------------------------------
	o win32 filter fixes for Alessandro's 11/29 report
	o Rellocated Macos reference links from code to REFERENCE-MAC.txt
	o Made sure all #ifdefs use _WIN32 instead of other variants.
	o Fixed problem with FLTK chooser not showing its icons (natevw)
	o Added macosx_*() platform specific accessors

    TODO: See ./TODO for outstanding items

0.81 -- 11/28/2005 erco: linux version cleanup
----------------------------------------------
        o Support documented filters
	o free/strdup -> new/delete
	o added #ifndef at top of FL/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.H to prevent recursion

0.80 -- 11/27/2005 erco+nate: code merge, cleanup
-------------------------------------------------
	o Merge in Nathan's changes
	o Updated docs for all changes noted here
	o Rewrote mac's filter code to support old "*.a" and new "Desc1\t*.a\nDesc2\t*.b" syntax
	o Changed Nathan's set_filter() -> filter_value() (consistent with FLTK's own chooser)
	o Renamed test program to test-browser.cxx
	o Code cleanup: variable + method naming, 80 column conformance, indents, strdup/malloc -> new
	TODO: Linux version needs code cleanup (strdup -> new, etc)

0.70 -- 08/04/05 erco: general cleanup
--------------------------------------

	o Implemented Linux.
	  This was easy -- just use Fl_File_Chooser.

	  the correct method name is total_filenames()

0.62 -- 02/02/2005
------------------

	o Added Ian's mods to main.cxx to use getcwd() instead of fixed path

	o Added #include/#define's to support getcwd() under Windows VS

	  and Makefile.fltkconfig, including tab fixes and line 90 .obj -> .o fix.

	o Enabled /Wall on Windows VS7.x, and fixed all problems related to Fl_Native*
	  (mainly, ctor type value was being ignored)
