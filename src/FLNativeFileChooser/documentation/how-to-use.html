<blockquote>
    The Fl_Native_File_Chooser project can either be added to FLTK, or
    installed as a subdirectory either inside your own project,
    or in a separate directory that all your projects can refer to.
    <p>
    Just be sure to compile with the -I (include) flag pointing
    to where the Fl_Native_File_Chooser directory is, and to link in the
    Fl_Native_File_Chooser.o file left in that directory after doing a 'make'.

</p><h3>Installing Fl_Native_File_Chooser Into Your Project's Directory</h3>
<blockquote>
    Here's an example of how to install Fl_Native_File_Chooser into your project's
    own directory:
</blockquote>
<pre>        ../src/YourApp/
	        |
	        |-- YourApp.C
		|-- YourApp.H		     -- Contains <b>"#include &lt;FL/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.H&gt;"</b>
		|-- Makefile		     -- Compiles with <b>"-I./Fl_Native_File_Chooser", </b>
		|                               links with <b>./Fl_Native_File_Chooser/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.o</b>
		|-- <font color="RED">Fl_Native_File_Chooser</font>   -- Fl_Native_File_Chooser installed as a subdirectory<font color="RED">
		:       |
		        |-- FL
			|   |
			|   |-- Fl_Native_File_Chooser.H
			|   :
			|
			|-- Fl_Native_File_Chooser.o
			|-- Makefile
			:</font>
</pre>
<blockquote>
    This way you can still just have <b><tt>"#include &lt;FL/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.H&gt;"</tt></b> 
    in your C++ files.. just use <b><tt>"-I./Fl_Native_File_Chooser"</tt></b> as one of the 
    compile flags, and the #include will resolve correctly.
    <p>
    During linking, be sure to link in 
    <b><tt>"./Fl_Native_File_Chooser/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.o"</tt></b>
    as part of the link instructions for your app.
</blockquote>

</p><h3>Recommendations</h3>
<blockquote>
    It is advised you locate Fl_Native_File_Chooser in the same source directory
    your FLTK version(s) are installed, eg:
    <pre>
    /usr/local/src/fltk-1.1.x-svn/		     <I>&lt;-- some rev of fltk</I>
    /usr/local/src/fltk-2.0-svn/		     <I>&lt;-- some other rev of fltk</I>
    /usr/local/src/Fl_Native_File_Chooser-0.84/  <I>&lt;-- put Fl_Native_File_Chooser here</I>
    </pre>
    In your Makefile, just add the Fl_Native_File_Chooser directory to your
    include path, and add the Fl_Native_File_Chooser.o to your link line, eg:
    <pre>
    # FLTK1
    INCLUDES = -I/usr/local/src/Fl_Native_File_Chooser-0.84/
    LIBS     = /usr/local/src/Fl_Native_File_Chooser-0.84/Fl_Native_File_Chooser.o

    # FLTK2
    INCLUDES = -I/usr/local/src/Fl_Native_File_Chooser-0.84/
    LIBS     = /usr/local/src/Fl_Native_File_Chooser-0.84/NativeFileChooser.o

    foo: foo.cxx
	    g++ $(INCLUDES) foo.cxx -c
	    g++ foo.o $(LIBS) ..
    </pre>
